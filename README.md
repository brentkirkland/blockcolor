This project aims to create a help ticket system that is built on the go-ethereum fork Quorum... and a demo that lives on a public testnet.

By using a consortium chain, I can keep private company information hidden, while still verifying that a company is working on your issue.

This is a work in progress and is being fit to a service company in Santa Ana, California.

This repo aims to lower the barrier to using a blockchain while preserving its useful properties.
